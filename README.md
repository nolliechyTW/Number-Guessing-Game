# Number-Guessing-Game
Write a program for number-guessing game (you may refer to Guess the Number if you have never played this game). The program first generates a secret number ranging between 0 and 99, inclusive. Then the program asks the player to guess a number. If the input value is equal to the secret number, then the player wins. If not, then update the range depending on the input accordingly. (For example, assume that the secret number is 42. If the player types 50 for the first time, then the program shows (0, 49) on the screen.) When there is only one integer left, the player loses the game. Also, make sure that the player types a number in the feasible range; otherwise, ask the user to redo the input.
